## Overview

Create a program that creates a chart for converting between units.

## Instuctions

You may use any reasonable unit conversion that you like. 
The program should define a function for converting a number from one unit to another unit. Then, using this function, it should
output a table. The table should have headings at the top, and then include at least 10 lines of conversions, where the original 
unit is in the first column, followed by a tab character, then the new unit in the second column.


## Example
```
Temperature Conversion Chart
deg F   deg C
0       -17.778
10      -12.222
20      -6.667
30      -1.111
40      4.444
50      10
60      15.556
70      21.111
80      26.667
90      32.222
100     37.777
```

## Grading

This program is worth 15 points.


*    Get 2 points for including appropriate comments.
*    Get 2 points for using C++ IO Streams for your output.
*    Get 5 points for making a unit conversion function.
*   Get 2 points for printing a heading and using a tab to separate the columns.
*    Get 2 points for using a loop to make the chart with at least 10 rows.
*    Get 2 points for calculating the value to convert using the loop and for computing the conversion using the function.
