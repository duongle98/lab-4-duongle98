= Overview =

Create a program that reads in a class roster and then greets each person in the class.

= Instuctions =

The program should read a list of names, one name on each line, from its standard input. For for each name read,
it should write "Hello, name." It should stop when there are no more names on standard input.

The getline function in the string class (http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/getline/) will be helpful. 

= Example =
George Candice
Steven O'Brien
Mildred
^D
Hello, George Candice.
Hello, Steven O'Brien.
Hello, Mildred.

= Grading =

This program is worth 15 points.


*    Get 2 points for including appropriate comments.

*   Get 5 points for reading input until the read is unsuccessful.
*    Get 2 points for outputting a greeting that includes thename that was read.
